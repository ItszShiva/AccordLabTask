            <p>Many believe that both Radha and Krishna never felt the need to marry each other in order to show or prove their love to the world. Well, this might look against the norms of Hindu mythology but if we thoughtfully ponder upon this, then two people actually don’t need to tie themselves in a bond and label themselves as husband-wife to stay together. 

                Krishna never cared if someone was his wife, friend, or other family member, he treated everyone with the same love and kindness.
                
                On the other side, Radha was never meant to be his wife because what they both shared was above the materialistic expectations that are tied to the concept of marriage. They shared a sacred bond that was built purely out of love. And hence, there was no need to put a tag on their togetherness.</p>
            <p>This might come as a surprise to you, but honestly, it is a fact, and many priests in India believe it. 

                Goddess Lakshmi (the wife of Lord Vishnu) and Rukmini were born in the same Yuga. it is said that Rukmini is the manifestation of Shakti who was born in the home of King Bhishmaka of Vidharba. 
                
                When Kansa ordered Putna to kill the child of Vasudeva and Devaki i.e., Lord Krishna, she randomly started kidnapping kids and putting them at harm. During this time, she also kidnapped Rukamani unaware of the fact that the little girl was an avatar of Goddess Lakshmi. 
                
                However, while carrying Rukmini along, Putna could not bear her weight and hence abandoned her in Barsana and left away. Hereafter, Vrishabhanu, a common childless village man found Rukmini and decided to carry her along with him.
                
                Later on, when King Vidharbha came searching for Rukmini, he encountered Radha carrying a lotus with conch shell marks on his palms. Radha was sent to Vidharabha and her original name, Rukmini was given back. She was brought up like a royal woman and later fell in love with Krishna and even ended up marrying him.  </p>
